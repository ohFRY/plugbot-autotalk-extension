## Plug.bot + AUTOTALK extension

A collection of extensions to the growing online DJing website, <a href="http://plug.dj">plug.dj</a>.  The source code is written in JavaScript utilising the Plug.dj API anywhere possible.  Easily embeddable as a bookmark in your favourite browser.

NB: Most of the code has been written by Conner Davis. I only have added the AUTOTALK functionality to <a href="https://github.com/ConnerGDavis/Plugbot">PlugBot Version 1</a>  



### Features List by Conner Davis ###
